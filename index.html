				<h2>
					Project CivicNode is about reconnecting people with their place, to end homelessness.
				</h2>

				<p>
					We execute action research in partnership with local communities who are experiencing hardship.

					<strong>
						Cities are living systems.
					</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					Networks are a building block of natural, social, technological and economic processes. We examine the intricate web of relationships inherent in modern cities and the processes that shape social outcomes.
				</p>

				<p>
					Our work will inform operational decisions that support vulnerable people in urban communities.
				</p>

				<p>
					Our multi-disciplinary team will generate novel evidence to identify leverage points within the whole system of supports and influences.
